Assignment
Context

You are building a small data analytics tool for a subscription SaaS product. The business wants a simple way to compute a few key metrics from exported CSV files.

You may use any Python libraries you like (e.g. pandas, pydantic, typer/click, pytest, etc.), as long as the setup remains simple (e.g. pip install -r requirements.txt).
Input data

You can access two CSV files:
customers.csv

- customer_id (string)
- signup_date (ISO date, e.g. 2024-01-15)
- country (string, e.g. NL, DE, …)

subscriptions.csv

- customer_id (string)
- start_date (ISO date)
- end_date (ISO date or empty for active)
- plan (string, e.g. basic, pro)
- monthly_price (numeric)

Assume one active subscription per customer at a time, but customers may churn and later re-subscribe.
Required output

Implement a small tool that, given the two CSV files, produces a JSON report with:

    Monthly MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) for each calendar month.

    For each month, sum monthly_price of all subscriptions that are active in that month.

    Monthly churned customers count

    A churn event is when a subscription has an end_date and the customer has no new subscription starting within 30 days after that end_date.

    Signup cohorts with 3-month retention

    Group customers by signup month.
    For each cohort, compute:
        cohort_size
        active_after_3_months: number of customers that still have any active subscription 3 months after their signup date.
        retention_rate_3m= active_after_3_months / cohort_size.

The tool should:

    Be runnable as a CLI, for example:

python main.py customers.csv subscriptions.csv output.json

    Validate inputs and fail with a clear message when required columns are missing or malformed.

    Log or otherwise surface data quality issues (e.g. unknown customer_id in subscriptions).

Non-functional requirements

    Structure and extensibility

    Organize your code so that adding a new metric (e.g. average revenue per user or LTV per cohort) can be done cleanly without turning main.py into a large script.
    Aim for reasonable separation of concerns (e.g. data loading, business logic, and CLI entry point).

    Tests

    Include at least a few tests (e.g. pytest) that:
        Cover the churn logic and 3-month retention logic.
        Cover at least one edge case (e.g. subscription ending exactly on boundary dates, re-subscriptions within 30 days, etc.).

    Type hints and documentation

    Use type hints for your main functions.
    Add docstrings or comments where they clarify non-obvious logic.

    Short design note

    Include a short DESIGN.md (max 1 page) explaining:
        How the code is structured.
        How you modeled the business rules (MRR, churn, cohorts).
        How you would add another metric in the future.
        Any assumptions you made and known trade-offs.

    AI Chat Log

    Include a note or file containing the relevant chat logs or prompts from ChatGPT, Codex or any other AI tools used during the assignment.
